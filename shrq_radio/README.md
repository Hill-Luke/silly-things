# SHRQ Radio

SHRQ Radio is a retro-style radio mix generator that combines DJ voiceovers with randomized music tracks, along with NPR and TPR news clips. It's designed for local use and outputs a single mixed MP3 file you can play as your own radio station.

## Features

- Pulls NPR and TPR news audio from public URLs
- Randomly generates a playlist from local MP3s
- Injects AI-generated DJ commentary between tracks
- Outputs a single MP3 mix playable anywhere
- CLI-based, no inputs required

**NOTE:** SHRQ Radio requires Python 3.12. Newer versions of python are not compatible

## Setup

1. **Install Python 3.11+**
2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **FOR WINDOWS USERS** Download and install FFmpeg (if not already installed):
  - Download from: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
  - Unzip and place the path to `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` in `C:/ffmpeg-7.1.1-essentials_build/bin/`
4. **Install Ollama** Pull `llama3.2:1b` for generating the DJ's script. You can pull whatever model you'd like to use, dependent on your hardware.
5. **FOR MAC USERS: Download the Piper TTS voice** Save it to the `TTS_tests` folder using `python3 -m piper.download_voices en_US-ryan-high`
5. **Store your MP3 music files in:** `shrq_radio/data/music/`

## Run
```bash
python shrq_radio.py
```

It will:
1. Download news clips from NPR or TPR (I live in Texas :) )

2. Generate DJ audio

3. Combine everything into a final mix

4. Save the result to `shrq_radio/output/final_mix.mp3`

### Notes
The DJ audio uses local text-to-speech synthesis. Processing time can take a while depending on the amount of songs you have in the queue and the hardware you're working with. 
Only .mp3 files are supported for the music playlist.
If ffmpeg or ffprobe are not found, the script will raise an error.

## Song Downloader:
As I listened to my music, I realized that a lot of my music was still from when I was in High School, which was a good and a bad thing. I added a small program that downloads the KUTX Song of the Day from the website and adds it to your music folder. Helps keeps my music library fresh!

### ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
