Thought: Now that we have the file details and a plan to move each file to its destination folder based on category, let's create the actual plan.


Action: Create folders for each category in the destination directory.

*   "audio" files go into "/Users/lukeofthehill/Desktop/audio"
*   "image" files go into "/Users/lukeofthehill/Desktop/images"
*   "text" files go into "/Users/lukeofthehill/Desktop/texts"
*   "video" files go into "/Users/lukeofthehill/Desktop/videos"

Action: Move each file to its corresponding folder.
